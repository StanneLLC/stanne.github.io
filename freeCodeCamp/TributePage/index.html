    <class="bio"><strong>If you needed to find someone who could be funny, and no nonsense at the same time, you need look no further than Mike Royko.  A man not afraid to tell it like it is, and yet somehow amuse you at the same time. A journalist among journalists, and gone before his time. I have yet to find a columnist I've enjoyed reading as much as him.</strong>
